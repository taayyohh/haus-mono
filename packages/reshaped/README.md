# Reshaped

Welcome to Zora's fork of [Reshaped](https://reshaped.so/). Reshaped is a flexible design system with an accompanying Figma component library.

This README is in progress and will be filled out more before we start integrating Reshaped components into our app.

## Storybook

Reshaped comes with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) stories for all the components. Storybook is living documentation for components, allowing you to interact with the components and configure various props to see the resultant behaviour. Run `pnpm dev` locally to view the storybook, or go to <REMOTE LINK ONCE SETUP>

In addition, we leverage [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=64c0a0dbb3a62a7b92358318) to host the `main` branch version of storybook as well as run visual regression testing. If the above link doesn't work, please reach out to Ilan / Sam and we can help get you set up and update the documentation.
